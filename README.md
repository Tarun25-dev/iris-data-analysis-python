# Iris Dataset Analysis using NumPy & Pandas
A beginner-friendly data analysis project using Python, NumPy, and Pandas on the Iris dataset. The project focuses on data exploration, statistical analysis, and extracting meaningful insights using a research-oriented approach.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze a standard research dataset (Iris dataset) using Python. The focus is on data understanding, statistical analysis, and extracting meaningful insights using NumPy and Pandas.

## Dataset
Dataset Name: Iris Flower Dataset
Source: sklearn.datasets.load_iris
Number of Records: 150
Number of Features: 4
Number of Classes: 3

## Tools & Libraries
Python
NumPy
Pandas
scikit-learn

## Project Workflow
1. Loaded the Iris dataset using sklearn
2. Converted NumPy arrays into a Pandas DataFrame
3. Performed data inspection using head, info, and describe
4. Used NumPy for statistical calculations
5. Used Pandas groupby for species-wise analysis
6. Extracted feature-based insights

## Key Insights
Setosa species has smaller petal dimensions
Virginica species has larger petal measurements
Feature values clearly differentiate flower species

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how standardized datasets can be explored and analyzed using NumPy and Pandas in a research-oriented workflow.
