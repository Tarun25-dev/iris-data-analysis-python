📌 Project Overview

This is a beginner-friendly data analysis and machine learning project using Python, NumPy, and Pandas on the Iris Flower Dataset.
The project focuses on data exploration, statistical analysis, visualization, and building a simple classification model to predict flower species.

🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to:

Understand and explore a standard research dataset (Iris dataset)

Perform statistical analysis using NumPy

Analyze data patterns using Pandas

Visualize feature distributions and relationships

Build a Decision Tree classifier to predict Iris species

📊 Dataset Information

Dataset Name: Iris Flower Dataset

Source: sklearn.datasets.load_iris

Number of Records: 150

Number of Features: 4

Number of Classes: 3 (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

Features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

Python

NumPy

Pandas

scikit-learn

🔄 Project Workflow

Loaded the Iris dataset using sklearn

Converted NumPy arrays into a Pandas DataFrame

Performed data inspection using head(), info(), and describe()

Applied NumPy functions for statistical analysis

Used Pandas groupby() for species-wise comparison

Created visualizations (histogram, boxplot, scatter plot)

Built a Decision Tree Classifier

Evaluated the model using accuracy and classification report

Predicted species for new input sample data

📈 Visualizations

Histogram: Feature distribution analysis

Boxplot: Comparison of petal length across species

Scatter Plot: Relationship between petal length and petal width

These visualizations help in understanding data patterns and feature importance before modeling.

🔍 Key Insights

Setosa species has smaller petal dimensions

Virginica species has larger petal measurements

Petal length and petal width are the most important features for classification

Feature values clearly differentiate flower species

🌳 Machine Learning Model

Model Used: Decision Tree Classifier

Reason: Easy to understand, interpretable, and suitable for classification

Result: Achieved high accuracy in predicting Iris species

✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how a standardized dataset can be explored, analyzed, and modeled using Python.
By combining NumPy, Pandas, data visualization, and a Decision Tree classifier, meaningful insights were extracted and accurate predictions were achieved in a structured, research-oriented workflow.
